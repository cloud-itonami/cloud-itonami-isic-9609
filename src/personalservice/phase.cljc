  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the personal-service analog of
  `cloud-itonami-isic-8620`'s `clinic.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- client intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds service-plan verification +
                                 background-check screening writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:client/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 finalize-referral` NEVER auto-commits,
                                 at any phase.

  `:actuation/finalize-referral` is deliberately ABSENT from every
  phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural
  fact, not a rollout milestone still to come. Finalizing a real
  personal referral or introduction is the ONE real-world act this
  actor performs; it is always a human provider-staff call.
  `personalservice.governor`'s `:actuation/finalize-referral` high-
  stakes gate enforces the same invariant independently -- two layers,
  not one, agree on this. `:background-check/screen` is likewise never
  auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same posture every sibling's
  screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here has only ONE member
  (`:client/intake`) -- this domain has no separate no-capital-risk
  'file' lifecycle distinct from the client itself.")
